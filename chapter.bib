	The paper is very convincing, with several example of sentences (namely:
	"move the white block onto the black block", "push the box with the
	bumper to the wall"...). The processor features: - incremental language
	syntactic and semantic analysis - disambiguation (by greedly refining
	the list of matching referents until only one remain) - "back-channel"
	communication (like nodding, gaze direction) is used (for instance,
	when you say "put the white...", the robot will immediately turn
	its head toward the white objects it knows) - based on sphinx/festival
	Limits: - apparently no explicit knowledge base (-> no reasoning)
	- examples are only for orders (sentences starting with a verb -
	imperative) - no experiments on real robots in this paper Note that
	latter papers by Scheutz ("robust spoken instruction understanding
	for hri", HRI2010) tackles the issue of language disfluencies, and

  abstract = {Ambient environments which integrate a number of sensing devices and
	actuators intended for use by human users need to be able to express
	knowledge about objects, their functions and their properties to
	assist in the performance of everyday tasks. For this to occur perceptual
	data must be grounded to symbolic information that in its turn can
	be used in the communication with the human. For symbolic information
	to be meaningful it should be part of a rich knowledge base that
	includes an ontology of concepts and common sense. In this work we
	present an integration between ResearchCyc and an anchoring framework
	that mediates the connection between the perceptual information in
	an intelligent home environment and the reasoning system. Through
	simple dialogues we validate how objects placed in the home environment
	are grounded by a network of sensors and made available to a larger
	KB where reasoning is exploited. This first integration work is a
	step towards integrating the richness of a KRR system developed over
	many years in isolation, with a physically embedded intelligent system.},

	Way better than us on the perception side. * They try the "2nd order
	logic" approach. I'd be curious to know what kind of reasoning capability
	they actually have. * Their tests are conducted in a static environment.
	They don't take other agents into consideration (nothing like perspective
	taking or rich disambiguation). * No task planning at all (or at
	least, not discussed in this paper) More in details: - object identification
	based on viewpoint independent SIFT features - formalized anchoring
	system that explicitely match percieved attributes to predicates
	- Cyc predicates - ground 12 colors, based on a paper on color perception.
	Could be useful for us. - idem, they cite a paper on what spatial
	relations to compute - location of objects based on a previously
	provided semantic map (but not much on this semantic map) - two "memories":
	the robot memory stores the current list of percieved objects ; the
	archive memory stores what is not percieved anymore - uses directly
	Cyc (ie, 250 000 common sense concepts...), via CycL language ->
	2nd and higher order logics (quantification over predicates, functions,
	etc) Remark: using 2nd order logic (ie meta statements), it would
	be easy to store the knowledge of each agent - disambiguation in
	concept name by asking human to decide amongst all concepts known
	by Cyc - template based natural language - experiment conducted in
	a "smart" indoor environmement + simple robot},

	watches Sally to put an object in a basket. Sally leaves and Ann
	moves the object from the basket to the table. The child is asked:
	where Sally will look for the object when she will return? The paper
	explain that children under 4 (as well as autistic children) doesn't
	answer "on the table" The robot can successfully pass this test if
	and only if it has an explicit and independent model for Sally believes
	on the world. So it should work with ORO. But it's a great experiment
	to set up! - The ToMM-SP model: Leslie proposes a general Theory
	of Mind Mechanism model based on what he call M-representation. M-representation
	are made of four components. An (1) agent, an (2) attitude (Leslie
	names 3 of them: to pretend, to believe or to want), an (3) "aspect
	of the world that anchors the agent's attitude" and the (4) content
	of the attitude. The example he takes is a mother that plays and
	uses a banana as a phone. If correctly understood by the children,
	this scene can be interpreted as: the (1) mother (2) pretend-true
	(3) the banana (4) to be a telephone. I would be curious to know
	your opinion about how feasible it would be to get the robot to actually
	understand the "mother and banana" scene. In false-belief scenarii
	(like the Sally-Ann one), the child must be able to attribute a false
	belief to the agent. Leslie adds to the model ToMM model a Selection
	Processing (SP) that allows the belief attributer to /inhibit/ the
	default (true) belief that he/she would tend to attribute to the
	agent. The whole model looks extremely relevant for us and I think

  abstract = {The idea of an axiom system having some models is explained more fully
	than in previous presentations, showing how the structure of a theory
	can give some semantic content to undefined symbols in that theory,
	making it unnecessary for all meanings to be derived bottom up from
	(grounded in) sensory experience, or sensory-motor contingencies.
	Although symbols need not be grounded, since they are mostly defined
	by the theory in which they are used, the theory does need to be
	"tethered", if is capable of being used for predicting and explaining
	things that happen, or making plans for acting in the real world.
	These ideas were quite well developed by 20th Century philosophers
	of science, and I now both attempt to generalise those ideas to be
	applicable to theories expressed using non-logical representations
	(e.g. maps, diagrams, working models, etc.) and begin to show how
	they can be used in explaining how a baby or a robot, can develop
	new concepts that have some semantic content but are not definable
	in terms of previously understood concepts. There is still much work
	to be done, but what needs to be done to explain how intelligent
	robots might work, and how humans and other intelligent animals learn
	about the environment, is very different from most of what is going
	on in robotics and in child and animal psychology. The addition of
	new explanatory hypotheses is abduction. Normally abduction uses
	pre-existing symbols. The simultaneous introduction of new symbols
	and new axioms (ontology-extending abduction) generates a very difficult

	embed an artificial agent into its environment such that its behaviour,
	as well as the mechanisms, representations, etc. underlying it, can
	be intrinsic and meaningful to the agent itself, rather than dependent
	on an external designer or observer. This paper briefly reviews Searleâ€™s
	and Harnadâ€™s analyses of the grounding problem, and then evaluates
	cognitivist and enactive approaches to overcoming it. It is argued
	that, although these two categories of approaches differ in their
	nature and the problems they have to face, both, so far, fall short
	of solving the grounding problem for similar reasons. Further it
	is concluded that the reason the problem is still somewhat underestimated
	lies in the fact that modern situated and embodied AI, despite its
	emphasis of agent-environment interaction, still fails to fully acknowledge
	the historically rooted integrated nature of living organisms and
	their environmental embedding.},
